### Data Science Tools
* MongoDB
* Beautiful Soup
* Selenium
* Splinter
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Limitations and Future Development
Web scraping can be affected by changes in website structure. If the websites used for data extraction change their layout, the scraping process may fail or provide inaccurate results. Future work can include making the scraping functions more flexible in terms of page structure changes and more robust in terms of error handling.
